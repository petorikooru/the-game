# The Game 
You just lost the game!

Welcome to Game Center, where you can play varieties of games. Do you love gambling? I do!

There are both regular user and admin, in which an admin has these features :
1. View every user registered
2. Delete user  

Basically there are 3 games (for now), which are : 
1. Slot Machine
2. Coin Toss
3. Random Number Guesser

Additional options :
1. Market (to buy credit for now)
2. Achievement

Planned Features :
1. Login and Sign-up [Done]
2. Leaderboard [Done]
3. Replace scanf with sscanf+fgets (memory safety reason)
4. ncurses integration so it will look much nicer (nvm)
5. idk, something that will comes up in my dream
